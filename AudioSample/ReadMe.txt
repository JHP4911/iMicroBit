This is an example program to play an audio sample on the micro bit,
the samples are restricted in length and quality by the memory limitations
of the micro bit.

To upload to your micro bit :

Open Mu (if you don't have it, get it here : https://codewith.mu/)
create a blank file
upload the blank file to the micro bit (This allows us to use the file manager)
Copy the contents of this directory to the Mu data folder (save your empty python script and search for it)

Connect a speaker between pin 0 and gnd, or use one of amp bits for a real oomph!

When the upload has finished, reset your micro bit, and you should hear a short sample.
